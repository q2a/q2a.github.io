## Clients

There is a [Q2A client for Android](https://github.com/NoahY/q2android), created by [NoahY](http://www.question2answer.org/qa/user/NoahY), and an [updated Q2A Android client](https://github.com/arjunsuresh/qaoverflow) by [Arjun](http://gateoverflow.in/user/Arjun/).

Both require the [XML-RPC](https://github.com/arjunsuresh/q2a-xml-rpc) plugin to be installed on the Q2A site you're using with permission given to users in Admin page.
