# Answers should always provide an answer

Answers that **do not fundamentally answer the question** may be removed, or moved as a comment. This includes answers that are:

- commentary on the question or other answers
- asking another, different question
- “thanks!” or “me too!” responses
- exact duplicates of other answers
- not even a partial answer to the actual question
- Answers are for solutions to the question. If you're looking to reply to a question, answer, or ask for clarification, Comments should be used for that purpose.

This rule may not apply to community-meta-posts, depending on their context. - This includes community meta discussions, announcements, etc.
