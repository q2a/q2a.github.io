# Why are some questions closed?

Questions that need additional work or that are not a good fit for this site may be closed by community moderators. Closed questions cannot be answered, but can receive comments. They can also be edited to make them eligible for the community when reopened.

These are 3 of the main categories and reasons why questions may be closed by community moderators.

- **Duplicate of...** - the fundamental goal of closing duplicate questions is to avoid duplicates and to help people find the right answer by getting all of those answers in one place.
> ♦ This question has been asked before and already has an answer. 

- **Too Broad / Unclear what you're asking** - Needs more details or clarity. Sometimes we need more information in order to help solve your problem. 
> ♦ Please clarify your specific problem or add additional details to highlight exactly what you need. As it's currently written, it’s hard to tell exactly what you're asking. See the How to Ask publication for help clarifying this question.

Edit your post to be more specific about what you're looking for, and be sure to address any concerns that other users brought up in the comments.

- **Off-topic because…** - well this is self explanatory. This refers to questions that are of off-topic subjects for this site. Questions that are impossible to reproduce and/or are out of the Q2A scope. such as private code, premium themes and plugins.
> ♦ This question does not appear to be about Q2A within the scope defined.

If you believe the question can be reworded to fit within the scope, consider editing the question or leaving comments for improvement.
